\section{Description of the Algorithm}

Both the \ac{scite} algorithm and it's improvement $\infty$\ac{scite} use a similar scheme: First, they either propose a new tree by modifying the previous one, or they propose new error rates. Then, they compute the likelihood of the tree and error rates, using different models. If the new tree or error rates are more likely to be correct than the previous one, these are accepted as the new, best values. This operation is then repeated multiple times and also restarted from random values. The final tree and error rates are the best ones found over all repetitions.

The only difference between \ac{scite} and $\infty$\ac{scite} is their likelihood model. Since $\infty$\ac{scite} can therefore be seen as a variation or modification of \ac{scite}, I will only mention \ac{scite} from now on.
