Single-Cell genome sequencing of cancer cells is noisy, but the SCITE algorithm is able to find the most likely mutation history of a tumor from these noisy sequencing inputs. As a Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chain algorithm, it has potential to be efficiently implemented on FPGAs. This is therefore the goal of my thesis. In my initial talk, I will outline the abstracted problem, how SCITE works and what possible opportunities and challenges lie ahead.
