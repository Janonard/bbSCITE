\chapter{Testing}
\label{ch:testing}

The goal of this thesis can be summarized as implementing the \ac{SCITE} algorithm with the same solution quality, but faster. We describe how we achieved this in the previous chapter \ref{ch:design}, but we also needed to verify that we met this goal. This chapter describes how we tested the solution quality of \ac{ffSCITE} and its performance.

\todo[inline]{Maybe write something about the Python scripts? Or only a theoretical description to keep it short and simple?}
