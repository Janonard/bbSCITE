\section{Ancestor Matrix Operations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item (Informally) Motivate updating the ancestor matrix instead of rebuilding it.
    \item Formalize mutation tree, reachability, mutation matrix, tree operations.
    \item Postulate update operations, proof correctness, report results
    \item Proof uniqueness of ancestor matrix
\end{itemize}
