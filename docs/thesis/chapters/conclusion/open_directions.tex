\todo[inline]{Note that time was lacking}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Feature: Homocygous/Heterocygous mutations
    \item Feature: Sum score
    \item Feature: Finding the most-likely beta
    \item Feature: Co-optimal trees
    \item New Feature: Continuous likelihood outputs
    \item New Feature/Optimization: Multi-Input
    \item Optimization: Pipelined chain step loop (increase throughput/cycles per step)
    \item Optimization: Customized RNG and distributions (Lower memory footprint)
    \item Optimization: Replicate MCMC step (increase throughput, requires pipelined chain step loop)
    \item Optimization: Transpose ancestor matrix (simplify memory access pattern, increase scalability)
\end{itemize}
