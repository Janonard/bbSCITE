\chapter{Optimizations}
\label{ch:findings}

In this chapter, we will describe the algorithms and data structures found in \ac{SCITE}, which form the baseline of \ac{ffSCITE}. Then, we will describe the design of \ac{ffSCITE} and point out key differences between \ac{SCITE} and \ac{ffSCITE} that improve the performance of the \ac{FPGA} design. Some of these differences require in-depth discussions and their correctness needs to be proven, which is covered in the following sections.
