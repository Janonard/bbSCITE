\chapter{Design of ffSCITE}

This chapter contains a description of the \ac{ffSCITE} design, which is essentially our biggest contribution. First, we will give an overview of how the design is structured and which parts of the design implement which subtasks of the \ac{SCITE} algorithm. Then, we will provide detailed insights into certain aspects of the design in individual sections.
