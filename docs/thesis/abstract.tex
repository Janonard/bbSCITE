\acs{SCITE} is a randomized algorithm that computes the most likely mutation history of a set of tumor cells, given noisy input data. The original implementation is designed for \acsp{CPU} and is very inefficient. We have accelerated \acs{SCITE} using \acp{FPGA} by a factor of 8.63 and empirically verified the solution quality using the \acl{TOST} procedure. Our biggest contributions are \ac{FPGA}-specific algorithms to query and update the data structures of \acs{SCITE}, as well as an optimized Input/Output system. However, we also identified ongoing issues regarding random number generation on \acp{FPGA}.
