\acs{SCITE} is a randomized \acl{MCMC} algorithm that computes the most likely mutation history of a set of tumor cells, given noisy input data. We have accelerated \acs{SCITE} using \acp{FPGA} by a factor of 8.63 relative to the reference implementation, using the Intel Stratix 10 \acp{FPGA} at the Noctua 2 supercomputer and Intel oneAPI. We also empirically verified the solution quality using the \acl{TOST} procedure. This performance performance has been achieved mostly by pipelining the chain step operation, which required introducing \ac{FPGA}-specific algorithms to query and update data structures, restructuring the score computation function, isolating the random number generation, as well as building an optimized input/output/feedback system. The remaining bottlenecks are the score computation function due its high number of required operations and the random number generation due to a high-latency data dependency. In this thesis, we describe all our optimizations, show their correctness and how they affect the design's performance.
